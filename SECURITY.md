## Supported Versions
Active updates mean that I will only be supporting the latest package.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you have a vulnerability that you need to report, please open an issue.
if this is relating to a private matter, then you are able to email me directly - kio [a] kitsunes.club.
Vulnerabilities will be fixed as able - with a response time of 1wk or less.

Vulnerabilities that will be immediately rejected:
- Works with or causes issues with a software that is not a soft-fork of misskey
- Modules that are developed by a 3rd party
- Frameworks or modules that are not explicitly made by cardboard or for cardboard
- Code that violates misskey's ratelimits (as misskey does not report its own ratelimits.)
- Odd happenings using misskeyRequest

Remember that you should analyze each line of a bot (whether running cardboard directly, or running inside a box) someone made for you, that you are going to run.
I will not take responsibility for someone else's module getting you silenced or suspended, putting forks in your toaster, sending messages that you did not authorize, eating your snacks, etc...
