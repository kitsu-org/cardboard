# <center>Welcome to Cardboard, Fedimaid! ðŸ“¦</center>
Cardboard is a wrapper (think discord.js, or the like!) for *key, but we put emphasis on support for sharkey. It's used by developers to easily communicate with servers!

## Why are you in my request logs?
When someone uses Cardboard to interface with your server, you'll see our Useragent. **We are not responsible for the traffic to your server!**

## How do I stop that user?
We hope that there's no issue with cardboard's usage, but we cannot individually stop a user from using our package. However, if you would like to prevent _all_ cardboard systems from working, you can block the cardboard useragent.
